# 📍 Assignment A4: Geospatial Python Libraries - OSMnx and Folium with Modular Functions

This directory contains the solution for **Assignment A4**, which focuses on demonstrating the use of **OSMnx** and **Folium** for geospatial data acquisition and interactive map visualization, structured in a modular and organized manner.

---

## 📌 Overview

The primary goal of this assignment is to showcase how to structure geospatial operations into reusable Python functions, adhering to good coding practices such as **docstrings** and **modular design**. This approach is especially beneficial for building scalable applications like **"FindMyRoute"**, where **clear separation of concerns** and **reusability** are crucial.

The solution is divided into two main components:

- `geospatial_functions.py`: A Python script containing core geospatial functions.
- `assignment_a4_notebook.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that imports and utilizes these functions to acquire and visualize data for **Salzburg, Austria**.
